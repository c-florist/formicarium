> An ant's nest, especially one in an artificial container for purposes of study.

A real-time simulation of an ant colony, built to visualise the emergent behavior of ants (for fun).

## Getting started

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/kyoh-dev/formicarium/releases) to download the latest version of Formicarium for your operating system.

## Demo

## Roadmap

### Core simulation
- [ ] **Advanced pheromones:** Improve pheromone system to guide ants to specific food sources.
- [ ] **Diverse ant roles:** Introduce different ant types such as `Queen`, `Worker`, and `Soldier` with unique behaviors.
- [ ] **Predators & obstacles:** Add predators and environmental obstacles (e.g., boulders) to create a more dynamic simulation.
- [ ] **Multi-colony support:** Allow multiple ant colonies to coexist and interact within the same world.
- [ ] **Nest interior vs exterior:** Distinguish between the outside world and the nest interior, allowing for complex behaviors like tunneling and brood care.

### User interface & experience
- [ ] **Simulation controls:** Implement UI controls to pause, reset, and adjust the simulation speed.
- [ ] **Interactive world:** Allow users to add new food sources or other elements to the world in real-time.
- [ ] **Pheromone visualization:** Create a visual representation of pheromone trails.
