## Improvements list

1. Improve pheromone following system so it influences direction to specific food source instead of nearest one.
1. Visualise pheromone trails?

## Proposed features

### Core engine and renderer
1. Introduce different ant types: `Solder`, `Queen`, `Worker`.
1. Add user interaction with world: E.g. allow for creating new food sources.
1. Introduce predators and design a system of interaction with them.
1. Add a collision system with obstacles, i.e. boulders.
1. Stretch: Distinguish between `outside` and `inside` worlds and allow ants to go inside a nest and dig tunnels, lay eggs, feed the queen.
1. Stretch: Support multiple ant colonies per world: Allow for up to X number of colonies per world, design interactions between them (often ants kill other ant colonies when discovered).

### UI/UX
1. Add simulation controls: Pause, Reset, Adjust speed.
