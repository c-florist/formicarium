> An ant's nest, especially one in an artificial container for purposes of study.

A real-time simulation of an ant colony, built to visualise the emergent behavior of ants (for fun).

## Roadmap

### Core simulation
- [ ] **Diverse ant roles:** Introduce different ant types such as `Queen`, `Worker`, and `Soldier` with unique behaviors.
- [ ] **Predators & obstacles:** Add predators and environmental obstacles (e.g., boulders) to create a more dynamic simulation.
- [ ] **Multi-colony support:** Allow multiple ant colonies to coexist and interact within the same world.
- [ ] **Nest interior vs exterior:** Distinguish between the outside world and the nest interior, allowing for complex behaviors like tunneling and brood care.

### User interface & experience
- [ ] **Pheromone visualization:** Create a visual representation of pheromone trails.
