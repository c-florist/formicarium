## TODO

### Currently working on
### Features
1. Add ant health to stats bubbles.
1. World creation with parameters: Allow user to specify parameters (starting number of ants, starting number of food sources, number of obstacles, ant spawn rate, max food sources).

#### Improvements
1. Improve pheromone following system so it influences direction to specific food source instead of nearest one.
1. Visualise pheromone trails.

### Proposed features
1. Introduce different ant types: `Solder`, `Queen`, `Worker`.
1. Add user interaction with world: Allow for creating new food sources and obstacles with limits (e.g. only 14 obstacles allowed at a time).
1. Introduce predators and design a system of interaction with them.
1. Add a collision system with obstacles, i.e. boulders.
1. Stretch: Distinguish between `outside` and `inside` worlds and allow ants to go inside a nest and dig tunnels, lay eggs, feed the queen.
1. Stretch: Support multiple ant colonies per world: Allow for up to X number of colonies per world, design interactions between them (often ants kill other ant colonies when discovered).
